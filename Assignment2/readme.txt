1) To run, open visual studio

2) click on the Local Windows Debugger

3) first part of the program will be that of the linked list and will ask you for your input accordingly

4) second part of the program will be that of the vector class stack and will ask you for your input accordingly

5) if you need the list of commands, just enter "help" when the prompt, "what would you like to do: " pops up

Notes:
The print functionality is restricted in the second portion of the program due to tendency to output garbage
numbers when allowing it

for position inputs I've made it so that out-of-range would be push/pop on the front/back respectively
because of this the insert/remove member function could take care of the push/pop operation themselves
